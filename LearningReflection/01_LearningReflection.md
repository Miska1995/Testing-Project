> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
   It was pleasant, I had some minor problems, but I managed to overcome them.   

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
I wrote after or sometimes while testing the Webapp.  Basically, I had the webbapp open on one screen while the test case on another.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
I cannot think of any as of now.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
I used Visual Studio Code to edit the files.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
Mostly some technical issues which are unrelated to this project.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
 I have never faced any problems while using Github. I have used github before, for example, in the Laurea's fullstack course.

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
Robot Framework, because I already tried to use it on this project and now I feel like I'm getting slightly familiar with it!


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
Technical Skills:

Programming Languages: Proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Java.
Automation Frameworks: Experienced with Robot Framework and Selenium for automation testing.
CI/CD Tools: Skilled in using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools, including Jenkins and GitLab.
API Testing Tools: Knowledgeable in utilizing API testing tools such as Postman.
Cloud Services: Familiar with major cloud service platforms like AWS and Azure.

Soft Skills:

Problem Solving and Analytical Thinking: Capable of tackling complex problems with effective solutions and a logical approach.
Communication and Collaboration: Strong ability to communicate clearly and collaborate effectively with teams.
Attention to Detail: Meticulous in ensuring precision and accuracy in all aspects of work.
Continuous Learning: Committed to continually improving skills and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
To advance in my career, I need to focus on several key areas for improvement. Firstly, I plan to hone my coding skills and gain more practical experience with the Robot Framework. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of cloud services, which are increasingly essential in software development.

On the soft skills front, I recognize the need to enhance my communication skills. This includes better articulating my thoughts and effectively conveying complex information. Furthermore, I am working on remaining calm and composed, particularly in challenging situations, as this will help me process and respond to complicated instructions more effectively.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-
I feel like I learned quite a lot. I even tried learning Robot Frameworks during some of my free time. This being said, I'm slightly worried regarding the out come of my final project. I worry that perhaps I haven't grasped the task as thoroughly as I should have. Nevertheless, I'm hopeful that the work I've produced is of satisfactory quality. This being said, in my opinion the quality of this course was pretty good in general. But some of the instruction could've been simplified.
